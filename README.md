# Robco-Housing-Sales-per-Month
Tableau file of Housing Sales per month in Robertson County, Texas 
I created this project to determine the price increases in home sales over the course of the past few years in Robertson County, Texas
more specifically, the four towns in RobCo (Robertson County), which are Bremond, Calvert, Franklin, and Hearne from Dec 2020 to May 2023.
This was a personal project to help me understand how housing increases in value simply as time goes by.
